# Code Smells Kata

**Smelly Tic Tac Toe**

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe. There are quite a few code smells in the implementation.

You can use the following resource as reference https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells
 


Start by identifying the smells and then slowly refactor the code. Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor. It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment.
